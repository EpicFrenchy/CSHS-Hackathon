            <p style="justify-content: center; padding: 25px;">Future well-being, in the context of youth mental health, pertains to the lasting positive impact that mental and emotional well-being during adolescence can have on various aspects of an individual's life as they transition into adulthood. It encompasses the development of a strong sense of identity, self-esteem, and resilience, contributing to life satisfaction, academic and career success, healthy relationships, and overall physical and mental health. Investing in positive mental health experiences during youth lays the foundation for a fulfilling and empowered adult life, fostering personal growth, societal contributions, and a higher quality of life in the long term.</p>

                <p style="justify-content: center; padding: 25px;">Youth mental health faces multifaceted challenges, including the pervasive stigma surrounding mental health issues, which discourages open dialogue and timely intervention. A lack of awareness about mental health symptoms and available resources further hinders early recognition and appropriate support. Social pressures, such as academic expectations and societal norms, contribute to stress and anxiety among young people. Bullying, both in-person and online, exacerbates mental health concerns, leading to feelings of isolation. Dysfunctional family environments, trauma, and adverse childhood experiences amplify the risk of mental health disorders. To address these issues, a comprehensive approach is needed, encompassing destigmatization efforts, widespread education, the promotion of supportive environments, and improved accessibility to mental health services for youth.</p>
